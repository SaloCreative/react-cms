<sup>1</sup> Using source maps breaks urls in the CSS loader - https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/232. Try [this](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/232#issuecomment-240449998) to fix it (but it breaks testing from local network).

## Setup

Tested with node 6.x and 7.x

```
$ npm install
```

## Running in dev mode

```
$ npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` from your browser of choice.
Server is visible from the local network as well.


It is using [webpack dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard), so please note the following:

**OS X Terminal.app users:** Make sure that **View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/).

## Build (production)

Build will be placed in the `build` folder.

```
$ npm run build
```

If your app is not running on the server root you should change `publicPath` at two places.

In `webpack.config.js` (ATM line 147):

```
output: {
  path: buildPath,
  publicPath: '/your-app/',
  filename: 'app-[hash].js',
},
```

and in `routes` (ATM line 9):

```
const publicPath = '/your-app/';
```

Don't forget the trailing slash (`/`). In development visit `http://localhost:3000/your-app/`.

## Running in preview production mode

This command will start webpack dev server, but with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.
Everything will be minified and served.
Hot reload will not work, so you need to refresh the page manually after changing the code.

```
npm run preview
```

## Linting

For linting I'm using [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb),
but some options are overridden to my personal preferences.

```
$ npm run lint
```

## Git hooks

Linting pre-push hook is not enabled by default.
It will prevent the push if lint task fails,
but you need to add it manually by running:

```
npm run hook-add
```

To remove it, run this task:

```
npm run hook-remove
```
